# OutSystems
These are some of the projects that I did when I was first learning OutSystems, they were for learning purposes only so they are very messy. I've attached the oml file so you can have a look yourself. 

# International Space Station
The international space station has an open API where you can get the longitude and latitude. So I used that API to overlay the international space station on a map to show where the international space station is live. 

# Guy Sports News
Guy Sports News was a website I built to replicate Sky Sports News but built by just one guy (me). I used this project to teach me a lot about CSS because it was difficult getting things to look exactly like the Sky Sports website did at the time. Also, I didn't use OutSystems built-in login and tried to build my own instead.
