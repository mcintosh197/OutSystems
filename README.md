# OutSystems
These are some of the projects that I did when I was first learning OutSystems, they were for learning purposes only so they are very messy. I've attached the oml file so you can have a look yourself. 

**International Space Station**
The international space station has an open API where you can get the longitude and latitude. So I used that API to overlay the international space station on a map to show where the international space station is live.
