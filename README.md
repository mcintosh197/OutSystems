# OutSystems
These are some of the projects that I did when I was first learning OutSystems, they were for learning purposes only so they are very messy. I've attached the oml file so you can have a look yourself. 

### Exercises
Most of the screens in the exercises oml are self-explanatory and haven't been built out much. Again, this was when I was starting OutSystems and there are much more efficient ways of doing these things. 

### Memory Game (Inside Exercises Oml) https://personal-co2xtgg0.outsystemscloud.com/Exercises/MemoryGame?_ts=638038803519114149
This is a game in that you turn over some cards and if the cards are the same they stay turned over and if not they flip back. Each of the photos is in a random place each time and when you click shuffle again the placement of the photos will change so you can play the game multiple times. 

### Dynamic CSS/CSS (Inside Exercises Oml)
Dynamic CSS was changing the styling of a photo depending on what button is click. The CSS screen is doing the same but just changing the colour of an expression instead of a photo. That one was done quickly because I was showing an intern how it can be done as he was learning OutSystems. 

### International Space Station
The international space station has an open API where you can get the longitude and latitude. So I used that API to overlay the international space station on a map to show where the international space station is live. 

### Guy Sports News
Guy Sports News was a website I built to replicate Sky Sports News but built by just one guy (me). I used this project to teach me a lot about CSS because it was difficult getting things to look exactly like the Sky Sports website did at the time. Also, I didn't use OutSystems built-in login and tried to build my own instead. 

### Email
This is self-explanatory and I was only using it to practice sending out emails when certain conditions were met in other applications
